      <p> Trevor Byron is an Austin based designer and story-teller. Trevor was born in Nairobi, Kenya and spent his growing up years in a remote Maasai village in the southern highlands called the Loita Hills.
        Trevor's introduction to design was learning traditional bead work, making necklaces and bracelets with his "koko" (Maasai Grandma).
          <br></br>
        Trevor designed his first website in 2005 for a punkrock band he was a part of. For kicks, you can check out the old screenshots here! After graduating from Westmont College with a degree in Social Science Trevor dove into creative work, making videos, designing logos and hacking together squarespace websites for artists and non-profits. He also apprenticed as a highend wood worker doing Finish Carpentery in Santa Barbara, CA.
            <br></br>
        As his creative experiences developed he started honing in on his design skills and in early 2017, Trevor graduted form and intensive 3 month training in UI Design from the Iron Yard Acedemy in Austin. Have a look around this site to get a feel for some of the work Trevor has done over the past few years!</p>
